    "Before Judo" he
    "When writing about the history of judo it is important to start before the beginning of judo because judo is a modified version of jiu-jitsu." p
    "the start of jiu-jitsu however is not clear because it is a fighting style developped by the samurai and at first also only for the samurai." p
    "around 1867 when the shogun era in japan ended and emperor mei took seat a lot of jiu-jitsu schools were closed and the profession of samurai became forbidden , this caused a lot of the old jiu-jitsu masters to commit suicide and the younger masters had to find a new job." p
    "after a couple of decades where there was almost no jiu-jitsu anyomore people started rebelling against the Mei regime and their drastical changes, these rebellions brought back jiu-jitsu because it was a very efficient fighting form."p
